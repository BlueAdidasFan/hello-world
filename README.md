# hello-world
I'm such a noob
Hi there, I'm blueadidasfan and I enjoy Electronics and RC vehicles as well as Disk Golf and MMA. I am in a career change period of my life and thought I might dabble in coding to see if it's for me. 

I think I would like to begin my journey in Paython, as as I understand, this is a common language that integrates my English language well and can really be used in a vast array of products and applications.

Any help I can find out there in the vast ocean of programmers would be much help and I will promise to pay it forward. So, much graditude to you and yours for your help, support and enthusiasm for this noob.

HELLO WORLD!
